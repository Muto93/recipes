        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 190 degrees C (375 degrees F).<br>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</p>
        </li>
        </ol>
